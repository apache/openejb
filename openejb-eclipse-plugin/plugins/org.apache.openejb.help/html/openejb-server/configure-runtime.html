<title>Configuring the OpenEJB Runtime</title>

<h1>Configuring the OpenEJB Runtime</h1>
<p>The OpenEJB Eclipse plugin provides support for running OpenEJB as a standalone server in Eclipse using WTP.</p>
<p>To setup a server, first of all, you will need to have a copy of OpenEJB extracted on your machine. Once you have that, the next step is to set up a runtime.</p>
<p>To set up a new runtime, click on Window, Preferences, and select Installed Runtimes under the Server category. Click the Add button.</p>

<p>Select OpenEJB 3.0.0 from the Apache category, and click next. If you choose to 'also create a new server' on this panel, you can <a href="configure-server.html">add a server</a> straight after configuring the runtime.</p>

<p>Browse to, or enter the path to your copy of OpenEJB. Click on Finish.</p>
