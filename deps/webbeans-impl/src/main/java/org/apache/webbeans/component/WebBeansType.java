/**
 * There are different <i>Web Beans Component</i> with regard to the definition.
 * These are the;
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bean Implementation Class Components</li>
 * <li>Producer Method Components</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Bean Implementation Class Components are defined with annotating the ordinary
 * classes with {@link OwbBean} annotation. It maybe defined within the
 * web-beans.xml file using &lt;class&gt; element. It is possible to mix these
 * two definitions.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Producer Method Components are defined within the class that is annotated
 * with {@link OwbBean} annotation. In these classes, there are methods that
 * are annotated with {@link javax.enterprise.inject.Produces} annotation.
 * These methods become the producer method components of this web beans component.
 * It maybe defined using the web-beans.xml file using the &lt;producer&gt; element.
 * It is possible to mix these two definitons.
