#  Each bean CMP EntityBean deployment has a unique KeyGenerator 
#  that is responsible for two operations:
#      
#      1. Convert the EJB developer defined complex primary keys
#         to Castor JDO Complex objects
#      
#      2. Extract a primary key object from a loaded Entity bean
#         instance.
#  
#  The KeyGenerator creates a new primary key and populates its 
#  fields with the primary key fields of the bean instance.  
#  
#  The KeyGenerators are generated as well.  The CMP Container 
#  will construct and compile a KeyGenerator for each CMP 
#  EntityBean deployed in this container.  The value of 
#  KeyDirectory specifies where the container should put the 
#  generated classes.
#
#  Default:
#  KeyDirectory   keys
#
#  Examples:
#  KeyDirectory   tmp/keys
#  KeyDirectory   ../path/to/mykeys
#  KeyDirectory   C:\openejb\CMPkeys
#  KeyDirectory   /usr/local/bin/openejb/keys

#  The passivator is responsible for writing beans to disk 
#  at passivation time. Different passivators can be used 
#  by setting this property to the fully qualified class name
#  of the PassivationStrategy implementation. The passivator
#  is not responsible for invoking any callbacks or other 
#  processing, its only responsibly is to write the bean state
#  to disk.
#
#  Known implementations:

#  Examples:
#  Passivator   org.openejb.core.stateful.RAFPassivater
#  Passivator   com.your.implementation.of.PassivationStrategy
    
#  Specifies the time to wait between invocations. This 
#  value is measured in minutes.  A value of 5 would 
#  result in a time-out of 5 minutes between invocations.
#
#  Default:
#  TimeOut  20
#
#  Examples:
#  TimeOut  5
#  TimeOut  60
#  TimeOut  9999
   
#  Specifies the size of the bean pools for this

#  PoolSize  50
#  PoolSize  200


#  Property name that specifies the number of instances
#  to passivate at one time when doing bulk passivation.
#  Must be less than the PoolSize.

#  Examples:
#  BulkPassivate  5
