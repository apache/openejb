===============================================
Examples for the EJB Container System and EJB Server

Examples v0.1.0        http://openejb.sf.net/
-----------------------------------------------

 This directory contains a few examples beans from Richard Monson-Haefel's
 book, Enterprise JavaBeans.

___________________
Building
===================

 First you must build the examples.  Running the BuildIt script will
 compile the examples and place the beans and the client code in the
 proper directories.  Change your directory to the OPENEJB_HOME 
 directory, then src, and finally examples.  Next run the BuildIt
 script.
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
   C:\openejb\src\examples> BuildIt jar
 
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
 
   [user@host examples]# ./BuildIt.sh jar

___________________
Running the Examples
===================
 
 To run the examples you need to do three things:
 
 - create the database tables on your favorite database server
 - update the mssql.titan_local_database.xml and mssqql.openejb.xml
   files with the proper driver configuration.
 - start the OpenEJB server in its own window
 - start the RunIt script
 
 For the moment, the examples only support MS SQL Server. Other database
 examples are in the works such as MySql, InstantDB, Oracle, and DB2.
 
 First, you can create the database tables using the script in
 the scripts directory.  Here, you would use the mssql.sql script.
 
 Second, you need to update the mssql.titan_local_database.xml and 
 mssqql.openejb.xml files with the proper JDBC driver configuration.  
 This is very site and driver specific but, if you need some help, 
 contact the user list mentioned below.
 
 Next, you start the OpenEJB server in its own window.  Open a command
 window and move to the OPENEJB_HOME directory, the directory where 
 OpenEJB was unpacked, and type:
 
   openejb start -conf ./src/examples/conf/mssql.openejb.xml
 
 Finally, change your directory to the OPENEJB_HOME 
 directory, then src, and finally examples.  Now run the RunIt
 script.
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
   C:\openejb\src\examples> RunIt
 
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
 
   [user@host examples]# ./RunIt.sh 
 
 That's it!  The example creates a bunch of CMP Cabin beans, lists them,
 and deletes them.  It also creates and removes a BMP Ship bean.
