OpenEJB -- EJB Container System and EJB Server

OpenEJB v1.0           http://www.openejb.org/
-----------------------------------------------
___________________
Installation
===================
 
 If you are reading this, you've already unpacked the OpenEJB release.  
 In that case, congratulations, you've installed OpenEJB.  

 The scripts for starting, stopping, and deploying in openejb are located
 in the bin directory under where OpenEJB was installed. 

___________________
Using OpenEJB
===================
 
 Now all you need to do is to type:
 
   openejb help
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
   C:\openejb\bin> openejb help
 
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
 
   [user@host openejb/bin]# openejb help
 
 You really only need to know two commands to use OpenEJB, deploy
 and start.  Both are completely documented and have examples.
 
 For help information and command options, try this:
 
   openejb deploy -help
   openejb start -help
 
 For examples on using the command and options, try this:
 
   openejb deploy -examples
   openejb start -examples
 
 That's it!
