Usage: openejb start [options]

Starts OpenEJB as an EJB Server that can be accessed by remote 
clients via the OpenEJB Remote Server.

ALWAYS check your openejb.log file for warnings immediately after 
starting the Remote Server.  

OpenEJB issues warnings when it works around a potential problem, 
encounters something it didn't expect, or when OpenEJB wants to 
let you know something may not work as you expected it.

 --admin-ip A comma delimited list of hosts and IP addresses that
            are allowed to administer this server.

 --local-copy=[true|false]
            
            When set to true, the container system will marshall
            (ie, copy) all calls between beans are required by 
            the EJB 1.1 specification.  When set to false, the 
            container system will pass parameters and return 
            values without copying or marshalling as is required
            for EJB 2.0 Local interfaces.  Default is true.
