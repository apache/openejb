    /*
    * The EJB 1.1 specification requires that arguments and return values between beans adhere to the
    * Java RMI copy semantics which requires that the all arguments be passed by value (copied) and 
    * never passed as references.  However, it is possible for the system administrator to turn off the
    * copy operation so that arguments and return values are passed by reference as a performance optimization.
    * Simply setting the org.apache.openejb.core.EnvProps.INTRA_VM_COPY property to FALSE will cause
    * IntraVM to bypass the copy operations; arguments and return values will be passed by reference not value. 
    * This property is, by default, alwasy TRUE but it can be changed to FALSE by setting it as a System property
    * or a property of the Property argument when invoking OpenEJB.init(props).
