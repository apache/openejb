Apache OpenEJB -- EJB Container System and EJB Server

Apache OpenEJB ${pom.version}      http://openejb.apache.org/
------------------------------------------------------
___________________
Installation
===================
 
 If you are reading this, you've already unpacked the Apache OpenEJB release.  
 In that case, congratulations, OpenEJB is installed.
 
 If you've unpacked OpenEJB into the directory C:\openejb, for example,
 this directory becomes your OPENEJB_HOME directory. The OPENEJB_HOME
 directory is refered to in various parts of the documentation, so it's
 good to remember where it is.

 Add OPENEJB_HOME/bin directory to your PATH environment variable:

   set PATH=%OPENEJB_HOME%/bin;%PATH%

 or

   export PATH=$OPENEJB_HOME/bin:$PATH

__________________________
Using Apache OpenEJB
==========================
 
 Now all you need to do is to type:
 
   openejb --help
 
 For Windows users, that looks like this:
  
   C:\openejb> openejb --help
 
 For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:
 
   [user@host openejb]# openejb --help
 
 You really only need to know two commands to use OpenEJB - deploy
 and start. Both are completely documented and have examples.
 
 For help information and command options, try this:
 
   openejb deploy --help
   openejb start --help
 
 
 That's it!
