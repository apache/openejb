Windows NT Service==================The two batch files for creating and removing OpenEJB as a Windows Service are basicallyself explanatory. Both scripts must be run using an account that has rights to installor de-install a service. This is usually an administrator account.service.install.as.admin.batservice.remove.as.admin.batIf a 'jre' or 'jdk' directory is found in an adjacent path to this 'bin' directory thenthis will be used as the preferred runtime, else the installed system runtime is used.NOTE: If you modify either of these batch files then ensure that there are no hiddencharacters after the '^' continuation symbol (such as tab or space). But always ensurethere is a space before (and not a tab). The service installer will drop further optionsand simply warn that '++JvmOptions' is unknown, leading to unexpected results.++JvmOptions=-Dopenejb.home="%openejb%" ^++JvmOptions=-Xms128M ^[tab or space] <-- Will break here, no further options will be appended++JvmOptions=-Xmx512M ^++JvmOptions=-XX:MaxPermSize=256M <-- Last line has no continuation symbol
