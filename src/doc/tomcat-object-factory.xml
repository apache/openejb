            <p>
                Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE) provides several technologies that lets build
                J2EE-compliant applications that can be run in any J2EE-compliant application server.
                One of the several technologies is Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI).
                JNDI is a technology that provides a unified access
                to different naming and directory services. Regardless of the underlaying service,
                if it supports JNDI a client doesn't have to know what exactly application it's to talk to
                other than it adheres to JNDI concepts and interfaces.
            </p>
            <p>
                OpenEJB and Tomcat can complement each other in fullfiling J2EE principles. OpenEJB is
                an EJB container whereas Tomcat is a servlet container. Although they serve different
                clients, both products use JNDI extensively. Obviously, either container provides different JNDI "views"
                of its managed components. The question pertaining to the integration is how to tie
                the different naming systems so that when a client requests an object from Tomcat naming space,
                Tomcat will know that it needs to pass the request along to OpenEJB naming space.
                That's what the object factory is to solve out.
            </p>
            <p>
                While reading JNDI specification you can come across the interface:
                <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.1/docs/api/javax/naming/spi/ObjectFactory.html">
                    javax.naming.spi.ObjectFactory</a>. The javadoc of the interface reads:
            </p>
            <body-note>
                This interface represents a factory for creating an object.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                The JNDI framework allows for object implementations to be loaded in dynamically via object factories.
                For example, when looking up a printer bound in the name space,
                if the print service binds printer names to References, the printer Reference
                could be used to create a printer object, so that the caller of lookup can
                directly operate on the printer object after the lookup.
            </body-note>

            <p>
                Theorically, it seems to be possible to create a web application that makes use of EJBs,
                deploy these EJBs in OpenEJB, and the web application in Tomcat, set up an object factory
                and finally boot it up. The following sections are to outline what exactly the steps are in OpenEJB and Tomcat
                with description of why they are required at all.
            </p>

        <section title="Before we start" ref-id="intro">

            <p>
                Before we start, ensure that OpenEJB and Tomcat are in appropriate releases.
            </p>
            <note>
                What follows should be doable on any Tomcat 4.x release. The author
                tested it under Jakarta Tomcat 4.1.18 (the most recent public release at
                that time).
            </note>
            <br/>
            <note>
                It's assumed that Tomcat and OpenEJB are already installed and running properly
                as a separate products.

        <section title="Referencing EJBs in web application" ref-id="ejb-ref">
            <p>J2EE 1.3 specification says (page 57):</p>
            <p>
                <body-note>
                    The Application Component Provider must declare all the EJB references
                    using the ejb-ref elements of the deployment descriptor. This allows the consumer
                    of the application component's jar file (the Application Assembler or Deployer) to
                    discover all the EJB references used by the application component.
                </body-note>
            </p>
            <p>
                It means that each time a web application needs to reference a bean, the bean has to be declared in
                the web application's deployment descriptor (
                <i>/WEB-INF/web.xml</i> file). The element which does so
                is
                <i>ejb-ref</i>.
                Although most containers don't enforce that approach, it's always better to describe dependencies in
                a standard, J2EE-compliant way, in the deployment descriptor of the corresponding components.
            </p>
            <note>
                Tomcat won't refuse to activate the components even if they reference EJBs with no declaration in
                the deployment descriptors.
            </note>
            <p>
                Our example's web application declares the referenced bean in the deployment descriptor
                (
                <i>/WEB-INF/web.xml</i>) as follows:
            </p>
            <code-block><![CDATA[

<ejb-ref>
    <description>
        EJB Reference to the bean deployed to OpenEJB

    <ejb-ref-type>Session</ejb-ref-type>
    <home>org.acme.HelloHome</home>
    <remote>org.acme.Hello</remote>
</ejb-ref>]]></code-block>
            <p>
                Here goes a JSP that uses the ejb-ref-name to get a reference to the declared bean.
            </p>
            <p>
                <file name="openejb.jsp"><![CDATA[

<%@ page import="org.acme.HelloObject,

            </p>
            <p>
                As it's shown in the sample JSP above, there is no direct reference to the EJB container to be used.
                The application component provider doesn't have to know what container the EJB is to be deployed to.
                What it does have to ascertain is that the name the JSP uses is actually an ejb reference. Moreover, the reference
                should be the one to HelloHome home interface or otherwise the application will fail.

                <b>CATALINA_HOME</b> environment variable points to the directory where Jakarta Tomcat 4.x has
                been installed.

            <p>The J2EE 1.3 specification says (page 56):</p>
            <p>

                    The Deployer binds the EJB references to the enterprise bean's homes

            </p>
            <p>
                It means that after an Application Component Provider (in the document, it's you) has created a web application
                and specified an EJB reference in the deployment descriptor, a deployer (you, too) has to bind the reference
                in Tomcat. The task boils down to put appropriate entry in Tomcat's configuration file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tomcat's default configuration file is
                <i>server.xml</i> in
                <i>$CATALINA_HOME/conf</i> directory. According to server.xml's documentation it's possible to
                create an appropriate definition of a factory and let the factory to handle requests for the objects it
                is registered to handle. That's what OpenEJB's EJB factory does. It intercepts messages for EJBs, passes it along
                to OpenEJB and returns requested bean.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tomcat registers resource factories in
                <i>GlobalNamingResources</i> or
                <i>Context</i>
                elements which demarcate the name space of different web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                <note>
                    It's recommended to place resource definitions within Context elements, which prevents name clashes
                    to occur when the same names are to point to different resources (e.g. EJBs).
                </note>
            </p>
            <p>
                The following snippet shows the elements necessary to register the EJB reference, which has been defined
                in the web application's deployment descriptor. The document doesn't describe the particular elements of
                server.xml file other than
                <i>ResourceParams</i> parameters.

                ResourceParams parameters consitute a bean reference. They inform Tomcat about who will know how to handle

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>factory</b> - (mandatory) the class instantiated by Tomcat when a request for a bean has arrived;

                        <b>org.openejb.client.TomcatEjbFactory</b> if the request ought to be handed over to OpenEJB.

                        <b>openejb.naming.factory.initial</b> - (mandatory) OpenEJB JNDI InitialContext implementation;
                        the parameter may be assigned to one of the two values:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>org.openejb.client.LocalInitialContextFactory</b> - OpenEJB is started in the same JVM as Tomcat;
                                it boosts performance drastically as the beans are in the same JVM as a client (e.g. a web application); it boots up
                                OpenEJB in the local mode - an Local (aka IntraVM) Server instance

                    <li>
                        <b>openejb.ejb-link</b> - (mandatory) the bean's name to be looked up in OpenEJB; the name doesn't
                        have to be the same as the reference's name in Tomcat; it's the name the bean may be found in OpenEJB
                        JNDI name space.

            <p>
                The
                <b>factory</b> parameter indicates the class which passes a request for a bean to OpenEJB instance.
                In order for the class to be instantiated by Tomcat, OpenEJB Loader has to be installed. The Loader takes
                care of loading necessary classes from OpenEJB directory. It finds the directory relying upon
                <b>OPENEJB_HOME</b> environament variable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Create a file named setenv.sh (or setenv.bat on MS Windows) in $CATALINA_HOME/bin directory with the following
                content:
            </p>
            <p>
                <file name="$CATALINA_HOME/bin/setenv.sh"><![CDATA[

export CATALINA_OPTS="-Dopenejb.home=$OPENEJB_HOME"]]></file>
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, add the OpenEJB Loader to Tomcat.
            </p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
                That's it. Tomcat is now fully configured to work with OpenEJB. Don't forget to start up OpenEJB instance
                if the factory's been configured with RemoteInitialContextFactory.

                example EJB to test things out. You won't
                need to do anything differently.  Deploy
                the myHelloEjb.jar just as described in
                <a href="http://openejb.sourceforge.net/hello-world.html"
                    target="_blank">http://openejb.sourceforge.net/hello-world.html</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Register the factory in Tomcat by editing server.xml, i.e. add the above Ejb element declaration
                between Context's tags of Tomcat's default <i>example</i> web application. Place the JSP - openejb.jsp -
                in $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/examples directory.
            </p>
            <p>Start up Tomcat and enter <a href="http://localhost:8080/examples/openejb.jsp"
                target="_blank">http://localhost:8080/examples/openejb.jsp</a>. As a result, you should
                see "Hello World!!!!!" on the screen.
            </p>
            <p>Tomcat should print out the following on its console (note OpenEJB messages about its startup):</p>
